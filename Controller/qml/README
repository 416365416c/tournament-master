To add a new tournament:
CLIENT SIDE
Main.qml will need a button for the new tournament, including the XML URL.
MatchEditor.qml will need to point to the correct cgi address

SERVER SIDE
The XML file (generatable by the tournament control application) should be publically accessible and world writable - this is not a secure competition.
The server needs to be placed in cgiBin or similar (to be run as a CGI program).
the xmlPaths.ini file should be created (I forget if this is automated) like in the following two lines, but with the right path for your tournament
[tournaments]
dummy=/var/www/dummyTournament.xml
