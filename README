App for running small local tournaments, preferably of Starcraft.

Server is c++/cgi and client is c++/qml.
Shared code for dealing with data objects in the common directory.
The new engin.io thing looks cool, but I already had a cgi app...

Note that the XML format is not "cascades-compatible". It needs to be loaded and parsed by Qt first. This is largely due to the fact that the standard <xml /> element at the top makes cascades choke.
Note that security is minimal, as the sensitivity of the information is minimal. Server access requires the same password compiled into the server and client.
